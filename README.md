 How to familiarize yourself with the software
-------
When the application opens, we can find the first interface that allows us to make a pre-selection of features. Simply check the boxes of features that are searched by the user. Once the user selects all the features he wants, he just has to click on the “Validate” button.
At this step, the second interface is displayed with 20 preselected pictures. The user has to select the image(s) which have the person who seems to be the most similar to the one he is looking for. Before validating his selection, the user can note (0 - 10)  the resemblance of his selection in comparison to the person sought thanks to the slide bar at the bottom of the page. Once his selection(s) are made, he can validate with the “Validate” button. New images will appear and the user can do the same actions as before. If he thinks he has found a resembling robot portrait, he can stop the process at any time by selecting it and clicking on the “Finish” button. This final image will be displayed on a final page where we can also find a “Reset” button to go back to the first interface.

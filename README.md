# Projet4BIM

This application is a tool to generate a robot portrait. During its use, the user must successively select one or more faces that will appear on the screen and validate. As the selections are made, the portrait must be closer to the one the user has in mind. The user can stop the selections when he thinks he has found the best robot portrait.
